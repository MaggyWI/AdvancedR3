TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is the advanced R course by the DDEA to improve
reproducibility

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: contains data that will be manipulated
-   `docs/`: contains the quarto doc and readme file
-   `R/`: contains functions and readme file

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
